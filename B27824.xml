            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>In a Perfect Account of the late FIRE in</hi> FETTER-LANE.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>ROBERT BIRD,</hi> whose House it was that was set on Fire, informed, That his Wife retained one <hi>Elizabeth Oxley</hi> to be her Servant (supposing her to be a Protestant) upon Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 24th. of <hi>February</hi> last, but she came not to her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice until the 6th. of <hi>March</hi> after. That upon Wednesday night the 9th. of <hi>April,</hi> about two or three of the Clock in the morning, the said Servant came to his Bed-side and awaked him, telling him <hi>There was a Fire in Halborn:</hi> Whereupon he asked her, How she knew it? she answered, By the noise in the Street. Whereupon he arose, and look'd into the Street, but there was little noise or light; so he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:200400:3"/> staid at his Street-door, until he was informed by two men that passed by, that there had been a Fire, but it was put out again: whereupon he returned to Bed, well pleased he had so watchful a Servant, and fearful of Fire: But none of his Family heard any thing thereof, until informed by the said <hi>Oxley,</hi> as he believeth. That on Thursday the 10th. of <hi>April</hi> he was told, the said <hi>Oxley</hi> went not up to Bed till about 11 a Clock: That before he went to Bed, he looked to the doors, windows, and rooms, to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e if all were safe from Fire and Thieves, (as his custom was) and was the last up in the Family, as he thought. That being in Bed and asleep, about 12 of the Clock that night he was awaked, with a great beating at the door by the Watch, and the said <hi>Oxley</hi> coming immediately to him, told him <hi>There was a Fire:</hi> To which he said, He was sure it was not in his House, but gave her the Key of the Street-door; who ran down, and let in the Watch and Company; and he coming down, found a large Press in his Closet (for keeping Books, Papers and Writings) on a light Fire, but by the mercy of God, and the great help he had, the Fire was put out, and his House preserv'd. That his Wife with some Neighbours immediatly going to the said <hi>Oxley</hi>'s Lodging Room to see if all was safe, found that she had packed up her Clothes and things ready to carry away, and her Trunks Lockt up, but nothing left in them of value: Whereupon he demanded of the said <hi>Oxley</hi> why she had packed up her Cloths? She answered, that she and his other Maid <hi>Martha</hi> had packed up her things to save them. Then he asked the said <hi>Martha</hi> why she had packed up in that time, when the Lives of the Children and Family were in that danger; who positively denyed that she pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up any thing: Whereupon, and for that he was sure when he went to Bed there was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And he said, that she the said <hi>Oxley,</hi> might have gone out at a Back Door of his House, and carryed away any of his Goods and Plate, if she pleased at any hour in the night, without Firing his House, the Key of the Back Door lying in the Kitchin, and laid there by her self. And he said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of value was found in the said <hi>Oxleys</hi> pack made up by her as aforesaid, but her own things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elizabeth Oxley</hi> upon her Examination said; that about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> last she became acquainted with <hi>Nicholas Stubbs,</hi> who had several times used many perswasions to turn h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That she telling the said <hi>Stubbs</hi> that she was Hired to Live with one Mr. <hi>Bird</hi> about the middle of <hi>Fetter-lane,</hi> he used perswasions to her at several times to set Fire on her Masters House; telling her, if she would do it, he would give her 5 <hi>l.</hi> and gave her half a Crown, and said, he would have other Houses in <hi>Holbourn</hi> Fired at the same time by others: That she being with the said <hi>Stubbs</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> before the said Fire, promised to Fire her Masters House on <hi>Thursday</hi> or <hi>Friday</hi> night following, and accordingly on <hi>Thursday</hi> night she took a Candle and set Fire to her Masters Papers in his Studdy which were in a kind of a Press; and they being on a Light Fire, she shut the Doors and went up Stairs into her own Chamber in the Top of the House, and packed up her own Things, and Undressed her self, least her Master should suspect her, and there stayed till a great Knocking was at the Door, and the Watchmen crying out Fire; whereupon she run down Stairs and cryed out Fire, and her Master gave her the Keys to open the Door; which done, all hands were imployed to quench the Fire. And she saith, she did not set Fire on her Masters House out of any Malice to him, nor with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to Rob him, but meerly to carry on the Design which <hi>Stubbs</hi> had proposed to her, and out of hopes of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
